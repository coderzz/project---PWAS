<h3>
India's rural areas do not have uniform access piped drinking water supply. In response to this the Center set up the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) which is responsible for funding and supporting infrastructure for piped water supply. They have a lot of data on their website and it is collected at the habitation level. 
<br>
This programme is also a prerequisite for other schemes. In order to have access to proper sanitation scheme benefits your habitation needs to have at least a particular percent(milestone) covered with piped water supply.
<br><br>
This application will serve as a medium to analyse whether habitation under various regions of country have achieved a particular milestone of piped water supply.
